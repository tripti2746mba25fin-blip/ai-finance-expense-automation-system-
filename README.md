# AI Finance Expense Automation System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end automated expense management system built using no-code and analytics tools. It integrates Google Forms, Google Sheets, n8n workflow automation, and Power BI to create a real-time financial tracking and decision-making system.

The solution eliminates manual expense tracking, reduces processing time, and provides instant visibility into organizational spending.

## Business Problem
Traditional expense management systems rely heavily on:
- Manual data entry
- Email approvals
- Spreadsheet tracking
- Delayed reporting

This results in:
- Increased errors
- Slow reimbursements
- Lack of real-time insights
- Poor financial decision-making

---

## Solution
This system automates the entire workflow:

1. Employee submits expense via Google Form  
2. Data is captured in Google Sheets  
3. n8n triggers workflow automatically  
4. Email notification sent to finance team  
5. Data available for dashboard analysis in Power BI  

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Google Forms (Data Input)
- Google Sheets (Data Storage)
- n8n (Workflow Automation)
- Gmail (Email Notifications)
- Microsoft Power BI (Dashboard & Analytics)

---

## Workflow Architecture
The system follows this pipeline:

Google Form → Google Sheets → n8n Workflow → Email Notification → Power BI Dashboard
